		<div class="halves">
			<dl>
				<dt>What kinds of businesses can LogoLand help?</dt>
				<dd>We&rsquo;re aiming to help small businesses, non-profits, authors, podcasters, and other moms and pops who want a professional logo, but can’t typically afford working with a professional designer.</dd>

				<dt>How do I know LogoLand is a good fit for my business?</dt>
				<dd>We design simple, typography-centric logos and minimalist geometric symbols. If you&rsquo;re looking for fancy calligraphy, hand drawn text, or an illustrated character, we&rsquo;re not a good fit. If you&rsquo;re after a solid logo to identify your business &mdash; sturdy stuff that would look good on everything from the side of an 18-wheeler to a business card &mdash; we&rsquo;re your people.</dd>
			
				<dt>What if I don&rsquo;t like my logo, man?</dt>
				<dd>That would be a turbo bummer, but we&rsquo;ve got a pretty great track record of happy clients. Trust the process, trust the designer. We want you to love it. If you like the work above, you&rsquo;re gonna like what we make for you.</dd>
			
				<dt>How many revisions are included?</dt>
				<dd>You&rsquo;re not paying for endless rounds of revisions &mdash; we gotta eat! We&rsquo;ll include one revision to color, composition, or typography. We reserve the right to bill any requests beyond that revision at an hourly rate.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Who do you think you are, what with your affordable logos and such?!</dt>
				<dd>We&rsquo;re LogoLand, a divison of <a href="http://blankenshipoffice.com">Blankenship Office</a>, an independent design studio in Greenville, SC.</dd>

				<dt>What&rsquo;s your refund policy?</dt>
				<dd>There are no refunds after you purchase this service.</dd>

				<dt>$1499 seems like way too much for a logo.</dt>
				<dd>First, that&rsquo;s not a question. Secondly, cool &mdash; it&rsquo;s your money. We wish you well. </dd>
			
				<dt>$1499 seems like way too little for a logo?</dt>
				<dd>Probably. But we&rsquo;re just <strike>naive</strike> optimistic enough to believe we can deliver a good product at this price point. It&rsquo;s not a full brand identity, and it&rsquo;s not a full-service agency experience; it&rsquo;s a professional logo at an affordable price in about a week.</dd>
					
				<dt>My business doesn&rsquo;t have a name yet, is that included?</dt>
				<dd>No can do, amigo. This is a logo service, not a naming service. If you need help with your business name, brand strategy, brand identity, etc. see the next question...</dd>
			
				<dt>Do you offer more than just the logo service?</dt>
				<dd>We do! Or more specifically, <a href="http://blankenshipoffice.com">Blankenship Office</a> helps new businesses and established organizations build brand identities &mdash; visual, verbal, and visceral. If you know you need a comprehensive design experience, an ongoing design partner, or you&rsquo;re not quite sure what you need, <a href="http://blankenshipoffice.com">please reach out</a>.</dd>
